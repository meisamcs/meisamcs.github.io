<h4 class="desktop-title">Short Bio</h4>
<p style="font-size: 16px;"><span class="mobile-title">Short Bio</span> Dr. Meisam Mohammady is an Assistant Professor in <a href="https://www.cs.iastate.edu">the Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.iastate.edu">Iowa State University</a> (ISU). Prior to joining ISU, he was a Research Scientist at <a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/">CSIRO</a> <a href="https://data61.csiro.au/">Data61</a>, which is Australia’s leading digital research network, helping various partners across business, government, and industry solve a wide range of data-centric problems. Meisam obtained his Ph.D. from <a href="https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/info-systems-eng.html">Concordia University</a>, Montreal, QC, Canada. Before that, he received his M.Sc degree from the Electrical Engineering Department of <a href="https://polymtl.ca/ge">Ecole Polytechnique Montreal</a>, Canada, and B.Sc degree from the Electrical Engineering Department of <a href="https://www.ee.sharif.edu/en/">Sharif University of Technology</a>, respectively. Meisam is the recipient of the <a href="https://github.com/meisamcs/meisamcs.github.io/blob/master/Certificate.PNG">Distinguished PhD Dissertation Award</a> among all Engineering and Natural Science PhD dissertations and was selected as Concordia University's nominee for both Canada-wide CAGS and ADESAQ competitions. Meisam's research focuses on developing responsible (Private, Adversarially Robust, and Fair) Machine Learning techniques including Federated Learning with provable accuracy, Differential Privacy, privacy-preserving cloud security auditing, security cyberphysical systems, and the internet of things. His research contributions are published in top CS conferences and journals, such as IEEE S&P, ACM CCS, IEEE TDSC, ACM TOPS, and IEEE TKDE.

<p style="font-size: 14px; color: #109c28;"> I am always looking for motivated students, visiting scholars/students, and undergraduate researchers. Please email your application materials to Dr. Meisam Mohammady if you are interested in our research. Graduate admission information can be found <a href="https://www.cs.iastate.edu/computer-science-graduate-admissions"> here </a>.</p>
