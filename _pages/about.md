# Short Bio

Dr. Meisam Mohammady is an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.iastate.edu) at [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu) (ISU).  
Prior to joining ISU, he was a Research Scientist at [CSIRO](https://www.csiro.au/en/)'s [Data61](https://data61.csiro.au/), Australia's leading digital research network.  

His research focuses on developing responsible Machine Learning techniques that are **Private, Adversarially Robust, and Fair**.  
This includes work on:

- Federated Learning with provable accuracy guarantees  
- Differential Privacy  
- Learning Theory  
- Optimization  

His research has been published in top-tier conferences and journals such as **IEEE S&P, ACM CCS, IEEE TDSC, ACM TOPS, and IEEE TKDE**.
