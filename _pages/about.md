 Dr. Meisam Mohammady is an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.cs.iastate.edu">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.iastate.edu">Iowa State University</a> (ISU). Prior to joining ISU, he was a Research Scientist at <a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/">CSIRO</a>'s <a href="https://data61.csiro.au/">Data61</a>, Australia's leading digital research network. His research focuses on developing responsible Machine Learning techniques that are Private, Adversarially Robust, and Fair. This includes work on Federated Learning with provable accuracy guarantees, Differential Privacy, Learning Theory, and Optimization. His research has been published in top-tier conferences and journals such as IEEE S&P, ACM CCS, IEEE TDSC, ACM TOPS, and IEEE TKDE. Access my CV <a href="_pages/CV.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
