# Recent News
- Weâ€™re excited to share groundbreaking advancements from our research team in privacy-preserving machine learning, showcased at premier computer security conferences. Our pioneering work on enabling the Laplace family in DP-SGD has yielded transformative results, as detailed below.
  - Our paper, *PLRV-O: Advancing Differentially Private Deep Learning via Privacy Loss Random Variable Optimization*, accepted at **ACM CCS 2025**, demonstrates significant accuracy gains using majorization theory to leverage Laplace noise in DP-SGD. It achieves over 11% accuracy improvement for ViT on CIFAR-10 and over 40% for RoBERTa-Large on SST-2, compared to traditional methods. Congratulations to Qin, Nicholas, Ayesha, and all co-authors!
  - Our paper, *Lap_2: Revisiting Laplace DP-SGD for High Dimensions via Majorization Theory*, accepted at **IEEE CSF 2026** (a prestigious venue for computer security foundation), further advances differentially private deep learning. By employing majorization theory, we show that Laplace noise outperforms traditional Gaussian noise in DP-SGD, delivering a 40-50% accuracy improvement at the same privacy budget compared to standard Laplace approaches. Congratulations to Qin, Nicholas, Ayesha, and all co-authors!
- Our paper, *FedSIG: Privacy-Preserving Federated Recommendation via Synthetic Interaction Generation*, accepted at **RAID 2025**, advances privacy in federated learning through innovative synthetic interaction generation. Congrats to Thirasara and the team!
- Our collaborative grant with UConn, UW, and IIT on *Privacy-Preserving Collaborative Data Sharing for Intelligent Transportation* has been awarded by **NSF PDaSP (2025â€“2028)**. Many thanks to NSF for their support.  
- Our paper *Towards Usability of Data with Privacy: A Unified Framework for Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing with High Utility* was accepted at **ASIACCS 2025**. Congrats to Chamikara and the team!  
- Our work *Harmonizing Differential Privacy Mechanisms for Federated Learning: Boosting Accuracy and Convergence* was accepted at **CODASPY 2025**. Congrats to Shuya and the team!  
- Our paper *UD-LDP: A Technique for Optimally Catalyzing User Driven Local Differential Privacy* will appear in **Future Generation Computer Systems (FGCS 2025)**. Congrats to Gnana and the team!  
- Our joint patent *Utility Optimized Differential Privacy System* has been granted (**U.S. Patent No. 12321478**). Congrats to Mengyuan and the team!  
- Our paper *DPI: Ensuring Strict Differential Privacy for Infinite Data Streaming* appeared in **IEEE S&P 2024**. Congrats to Shuya and the team!
