**Dr. Meisam Mohammady** is an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.iastate.edu) at [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu) (ISU), where his research focuses on developing responsible Machine Learning methods that are **privacy-preserving, adversarially robust, and fair**, leveraging tools such as *Differential Privacy, Learning Theory,* and *Optimization*, with applications in *High Performance Computing (HPC), Federated Learning (FL), Networking, Anomaly Detection,* and *Private Retrieval*. His research has been published in top-tier conferences and journals such as **IEEE S&P, ACM CCS, IEEE TDSC, ACM TOPS, and IEEE TKDE**.

Prior to joining ISU, he was a Research Scientist at [CSIRO](https://www.csiro.au/en/)'s [Data61](https://data61.csiro.au/), Australia's leading digital research network.
