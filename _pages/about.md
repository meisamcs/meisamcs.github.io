  Dr. Meisam Mohammady is an Assistant Professor in <a href="https://www.cs.iastate.edu">the Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.iastate.edu">Iowa State University</a> (ISU). Prior to joining ISU, he was a Research Scientist at <a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/">CSIRO</a> <a href="https://data61.csiro.au/">Data61</a>, which is Australiaâ€™s leading digital research network, helping various partners across business, government, and industry solve a wide range of data-centric problems. Meisam obtained his Ph.D. from <a href="https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/info-systems-eng.html">Concordia University</a>, Montreal, QC, Canada. Before that, he received his M.Sc degree from the Electrical Engineering Department of <a href="https://polymtl.ca/ge">Ecole Polytechnique Montreal</a>, Canada, and B.Sc degree from the Electrical Engineering Department of <a href="https://www.ee.sharif.edu/en/">Sharif University of Technology</a>, respectively. Meisam is the recipient of the <a href="https://github.com/meisamcs/meisamcs.github.io/blob/master/Certificate.PNG">Distinguished PhD Dissertation Award</a> among all Engineering and Natural Science PhD dissertations and was selected as Concordia University's nominee for both Canada-wide CAGS and ADESAQ competitions. Meisam's research focuses on developing responsible (Private, Adversarially Robust, and Fair) Machine Learning techniques including Federated Learning with provable accuracy, Differential Privacy, Learning Theory and Optimization. His research contributions are published in top CS conferences and journals, such as IEEE S&P, ACM CCS, IEEE TDSC, ACM TOPS, and IEEE TKDE.
