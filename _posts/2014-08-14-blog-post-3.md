### Summary

A review by Aguirre *et al.* explores the **hardware realization of memristor-based artificial neural networks (ANNs)**, highlighting how memristors—devices that combine memory and computation—can dramatically improve energy efficiency and computational throughput through massively parallel, near-memory computing architectures :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

The authors examine the working principles of memristive elements, discuss various architectural design options—such as crossbar arrays and in-memory computation circuits—and survey the tools required to evaluate performance metrics. They also address practical challenges for deployment, providing a comprehensive guide for researchers developing memristive ANNs :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
